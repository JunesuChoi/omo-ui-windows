# src/ui — app shell and lane slots

`src/App.tsx` builds the store and actions once, connects the bridge, loads preferences, applies theme and locale, and renders either `<Onboarding/>` (bridge state `not-found`) or `<AppFrame sidebar={<Sidebar/>} main={<ConnectionBanner/> + <ConversationPane/> + <Composer/>} rightPanel={<SidePanel/> while the side chat is open}/>` plus `<SettingsDialog/>`. Each slot component lives in its own directory:

| Directory | Lane | Export |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/ui/sidebar/` | sidebar | `Sidebar` |
| `src/ui/conversation/` | conversation | `ConversationPane` |
| `src/ui/composer/` | composer | `Composer` |
| `src/ui/settings/` | settings | `SettingsDialog` |
| `src/ui/onboarding/` | shell/onboarding | `Onboarding`, `ConnectionBanner` |
| `src/ui/shell/` | shell (owned here) | `AppFrame`, `columns.ts` |
| `src/ui/btw/` | /btw side chat | `SidePanel`, `SideToggle`, `useSidePanelShortcut` (⌘E), `useAskSide` |

## Shared modules

- **Side chat:** `src/state/btw.ts` owns `state.btw` (the panel flag, side chats per main thread, selection, drafts, the detached-context flag) and the rules that keep side threads out of `selectThreadsByWorkspace`. `src/ui/btw/background.ts` builds a side chat's first message (marker line, read-only rule, at most 64 recent messages and 64 KiB, then the question); the composer intercepts `/btw` and `/side` before `turn/start`, so omo never receives them. Side chats persist in localStorage under `omo-ui.side-chats.v1` through `localSideStorage()`, and their notices render in the panel instead of as toasts. AppFrame docks the panel as a third column while the center keeps 400 px, and overlays the main column otherwise.
- `src/ui/app-context.tsx`: `useActions()` (throws outside the provider), `ActionsContext`, and re-exports of `StoreContext` / `useAppSelector` from `src/state`.
- `src/ui/ui-state.ts`: a tiny external store read with `useUiState()` — `settingsOpen`, `sidebarVisible`, `sidebarWidth` (default 280, clamped 220–420) and `preferences`. Setters live on the `uiState` object (`setSettingsOpen`, `setSidebarVisible`, `toggleSidebar`, `setSidebarWidth`, `setPreferences`).
- **Preferences for the settings lane:** call `updatePreferences(patch)` from `src/ui/ui-state.ts`. It writes through `window.omo.setPreferences`, records the stored result in `uiState.preferences`, and `App.tsx` re-applies the theme (`applyThemePreference`) and locale (`resolveLocale`) from that value. Read the current preferences with `useUiState().preferences` (null until the first `getPreferences` resolves).
- `src/ui/new-session.ts`: `useNewSessionFlow()` returns `() => Promise<string | null>`: `window.omo.pickDirectory(lastWorkspace)` then `actions.newThread(cwd)`. Menu `new-session`, the sidebar's dashed "New project" button (`TESTID.newSession`), and the composer (when no thread is active) all use it. A workspace group's compose icon calls `actions.newThread(cwd)` directly.
- `src/ui/sidebar/`: the brand row (app mark, "OmO", a "DEV" badge while `package.json` version is below 1.0.0, the collapse toggle), a search field that filters rows by title or preview (`thread-filter.ts`; Esc or the clear button resets it), filter pills under it that keep only running threads (the pill counts them) or threads updated today (since local midnight) or in the last 7 or 30 days (one period at a time; pressing the pressed pill releases it, and a list the filters empty offers "Clear filters"), workspace groups with a chevron, an initials badge (`workspace-badge.ts`: two letters from the folder name, hue hashed from the cwd), the thread count and the compose icon, and thread rows with the badge, title, relative time (`thread-time.ts`) and a grip button opening the rename/reveal/delete menu.
- `src/ui/conversation/OpenButton.tsx`: the header's split button. `window.omo.listOpenTargets()` lists installed targets (VS Code, Cursor, Terminal, always Finder); `window.omo.openWorkspace(cwd, target?)` opens the thread's cwd, defaulting to the first installed editor, else Finder. The main handler (`electron/open-workspace.ts`) validates the cwd (absolute, existing directory) and the target allowlist, detects editors with `mdfind` by bundle id and launches with `/usr/bin/open -b`; it takes an injectable exec for tests. While the sidebar is collapsed the header shows a sidebar toggle at its leading edge.
- `src/ui/composer/magic-keyword.ts`: whole-word `ulw` / `ultrawork` / `ulw-loop` (also as the `/ulw-loop` command) detection. While the draft holds one, the card border turns into the orange→green gradient, the keyword renders as gradient text in a mirror layer behind the transparent textarea, and a hint line names the keyword. The sent text is unchanged. The "Full access" chip is a status (omo runs with full access), not a picker.
- `src/ui/theme.ts`: `applyThemePreference(pref)` toggles `data-ds-dark-theme` on `<body>`; `"system"` follows `prefers-color-scheme` until the returned cleanup runs.
- `src/ui/testids.ts`: `TESTID` — use these values exactly on the matching elements.
- `src/i18n/`: `useT()` returns `t(key, vars?)`; keys are namespaced (`shell.newSession`) and live in `common.ts`, `shell.ts`, `conversation.ts`, `composer.ts`. The `ko` object of each dictionary must have exactly the `en` keys (compile-time check in `src/i18n/index.ts`).

## macOS window chrome

`AppFrame` sets `document.documentElement.dataset.platform = "darwin"` when `window.omo.platform === "darwin"`. Under that attribute `src/ui/app.css` makes the page transparent so the BrowserWindow's `vibrancy: "sidebar"` shows through the sidebar column, marks every `[data-window-drag]` element and the frame's top 52 px strips as window-drag regions, and subtracts every interactive element (`button`, `input`, `[role=...]`, …) from them. The sidebar reserves the 52 px top strip for the traffic lights at (16, 18); main-pane headers pad their inline start with `var(--dsh-frame-leading-clearance, 0px)`, which is non-zero only while the sidebar is hidden. Overlays use `var(--dsh-frame-overlay-top)` for their top inset.

## Styling rules

Only DSH `--dsw-*` / `--ds-*` variables (see `src/dsh/theme/design-platform.css`) through CSS modules; no hardcoded colors. `src/ui/theme/omo-theme.css` loads last and overrides the token values with the OmO palette (Geist and Geist Mono from `src/dsh/theme/geist-font.css`, neutral text on violet-tinted light/dark backgrounds, which also cover the DSH layer, bubble, code-block, sidebar-item and menu fills, the radius scale) and declares the OmO-only tokens (`--dsw-omo-*`: accents and the icon color on them, keyword gradient, badge saturation/lightness, sidebar glow, the violet tint of the translucent macOS sidebar). In the dark theme `--dsw-alias-label-primary-foreground` stays dark because the DSH primary fill is light there. Dark theme is `body[data-ds-dark-theme]`.

## QA

```sh
npm run build
node scripts/qa-screenshot.mjs --fake --pick-dir "$(mktemp -d)" --out /tmp/omo-ui-g2/<lane>/light.png
node scripts/qa-screenshot.mjs --fake --theme dark --pick-dir "$(mktemp -d)" --out /tmp/omo-ui-g2/<lane>/dark.png
node scripts/qa-screenshot.mjs --fake --size 900x700 --steps steps.json --out /tmp/omo-ui-g2/<lane>/narrow.png
node scripts/qa-screenshot.mjs --omo /nonexistent/omo --out /tmp/omo-ui-g2/<lane>/onboarding.png
```

`--help` lists every flag and the step vocabulary. The driver waits until `<html data-bridge-state>` (set by `App.tsx` from the bridge status) leaves `locating`/`starting`/`restarting`; e2e tests can wait on the same attribute. Every capture waits for finite animations to finish and is flattened over the theme's opaque `--dsw-specific-sidebar-fill`, because CDP screenshots do not include the native vibrancy layer behind the transparent page. Electron 44 has no install script; the first launch downloads its binary, and `node node_modules/electron/install.js` does that ahead of time.
